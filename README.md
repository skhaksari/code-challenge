# Grove coding challenge
------
This repo is my solution to the Grove coding challenge, as described in [this readme](https://github.com/groveco/code-challenge). This coding challenge asks the participant to create a CLI that allows for a user to find the closest store (provided in a CSV file of stores) to the entered zip code or address.
